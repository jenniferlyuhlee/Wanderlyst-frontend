# WanderLyst
### Overview:
Welcome to WanderLyst, a travel app that allows users to create and share itineraries based on interest tags (shopping, eating, historical sites, etc.). WanderLyst simplifies travel-planning stress by letting users explore itineraries that match their traveling style and interests, or search based on filters (country, duration, tags). The itineraries display custom Google Maps based on the location inputs. Registered users have access to a profile where they can customize their information, as well as view the itineraries they've created and liked.
